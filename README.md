Program to change update modes of a digital micromirror device

TODO:
 clock stuff
 -- if htere is a variable that sets the clock speed we should check
 -- if there is a variable that monitors real time voltage ideal (may not exist)
 -- also look into external clocking pulses and setting a software side override.
 

 -- once we get access to the TI login.
 -- controller board drivers/GUI
 -- .dll file for the API
 -- confirm that we can turn the boar don without the DMD
 -- should be able to test code.
